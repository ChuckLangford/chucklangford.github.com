<p>This is pretty much what you expect it to be, another blog from another developer, writing about the things he learns.</p>

<p>I have a few goals for myself with this blog:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Share new things that I learn: My job offers plenty of opportunities to try new things and experiment.</li>
  <li>Improve my writing skill: Frankly, it’s time for me to level up in the communication department.</li>
  <li>Remember stuff: There’s just too much stuff to remember.  Evernote is great, but a public site has it’s advantages.</li>
</ul>

<p>So that’s it.  Drafts are in progress and I have a goal of posting on a psuedo regular basis.  We’ll see how this turns out.</p>

<p>Happy Coding</p>
