title: What's This all About?
---
This is pretty much what you expect it to be, another blog from another developer, writing about the things he learns as a programmer.

I have a few goals for myself with this blog:

*	Share new things that I learn: My job offers plenty of opportunities to try new things and experiment.
*	Improve my writing skill: Frankly, it's time for me to level up in the communication department.
*	Remember stuff: There's just too much stuff to remember.  Evernote is great, but a public site has it's advantages.

So that's it.  Drafts are in progress and I have a goal of posting on a psuedo regular basis.  We'll see how this turns out.

Happy Coding
