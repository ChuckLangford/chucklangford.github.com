title: Browser Timing API's
---

I was fortunate enough to be able to attend the Velocity conference in New York and I have to say, I'm pretty pumped about what I've learned.  There's actually so much to share that it'll take a little time to get through so today I thought I'd start with the timing api's.

### What are the Timing API's?

Long story short, the api's allow us to measure real web page timing metrics using javascript.  This is awesome because we can report on exactly what kind of experience our users are actually having when they visit our sites.

There are three separate api's that are available: Navigation, Resource, and User.

### Navigation Timing

### Resource Timing

### User Timing
