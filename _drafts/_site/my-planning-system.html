<p>In a recent office meeting, I had the opportunity to share my current planning system.  I explained a bit about what I do to plan my days and keep track of my goals and there was enough interest that I was asked to lead a lunch and learn on the subject.  So I figured I might as well go ahead and share the same here.</p>

<h3 id="in-a-nutshell">In a Nutshell</h3>

<p>Everyday, I fill out a daily planning worksheet. It is split into two main parts: The Morning Ritual and The Evening Ritual.  They’re so named because I wanted to think of them as something I automatically do when I wake up and before bed.  At the end of each section, I include a few personal reminders of mental exercises I want to run through as well.  Really, the purpose of the entire worksheet is to prompt me to think about or do something.</p>

<p>After filling in the worksheet, I take all the actionable items and transfer them into a ‘proper’ todo list application.  Throughout the day, I refer to this list to make sure I’m addressing everything from the worksheet.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I go back to the same worksheet and fill out The Evening Ritual.  This gives me an opportunity to review my day and learn a few lessons.</p>

<h3 id="the-worksheet">The Worksheet</h3>

<p>Below is a slimmed down version of my daily worksheet.  I’ve removed things that apply to me.  If you decide to utilize this worksheet, you really should personalize to fit your needs.  Also, don’t be afraid to change your worksheet at any time.</p>

<p>Most of questions are pretty self explanatory, however, I’ve added notes where I think they might help.</p>

<h2 id="the-morning-ritual">The Morning Ritual</h2>

<h1 id="my-stand">My Stand</h1>
<p>**This came from another exercise.  It lists the things you stand for.  I like to review these everyday.</p>

<h1 id="my-values">My Values</h1>
<p>**This lists the things that I value and the things I want less of.  Think of it as two categories: things I want more of in my life, and things I want less of.</p>

<p>How am I going to take care of the four parts of my being today? Or how will I deliberately practice them?</p>

<p>One good thing about myself:</p>

<p>What and whom am I grateful for today?</p>

<p>What am I excited about and looking forward to doing today?</p>

<p>What is my purpose, and do my plans for today connect me to it?</p>

<p>How can I move the dial toward my goals today?</p>

<p>To whom can I reach out and serve or thank today?</p>

<p>Are my goals still aligned with my purpose?</p>

<p>The One Thing (the most important thing I will achieve this day and/or week):</p>

<p>Priority Tasks (that I must complete today or this week):</p>

<p>Projects (to work on one step at a minimum each day):</p>

<p>Contacts (calls/emails to people I need to connect with):</p>

<p>Habit (what am I working on this week, and how):</p>

<p>Notes, Ideas, Inspiration (any ideas that came up during the morning ritual):</p>

<h2 id="the-evening-ritual">The Evening Ritual</h2>

<p>Did I achieve my One Thing?</p>

<p>Was I “on” and in the zone today or “off” and unbalanced?</p>

<p>What contributed to this feeling?</p>

<p>What were the top three positive things I accomplished or that happened today?</p>

<p>What did I learn from them?</p>

<p>Are there unsolved challenges I would like my subconscious mind to help me solve tonight?</p>

<p>What went wrong today and what is the silver lining?</p>

<p>One thing I’m grateful for:</p>
